# üîç Penetration Testing Project

## üìå Overview
This project documents a comprehensive penetration test performed on a real, live network environment (Universiti's "eduroam" network). The goal of this penetration test was to familiarize myself with different commonly used penetration testing tools, and discover if there were any vulnerabilities on the network.

---

## üß† Objectives
- Identify assets and stakeholders; what is the risk?
- Identify adversaries
- Position myself within the eduoroam network
- Use a port-discovery tool to identify open ports on the network
- Narrow down my results using different tools
- Connect to discovered devices, identify any vulnerabilities
- Prepare a report, and notify the proper authority at WIT

## üß∞ Tools & Technologies
- **Operating System**: Kali Linux
- **Tools Used**:  
  - Masscan
  - NMAP

## Preparation

In order to figure out what devices were exploitable on the network, we first did one massive port scan of the entire eduoroam private address space (10.0.0.0/8). Doing this I discovered that the different devices on the network tended to be grouped together under smaller subnets. I then used NMAP to scan these smaller subnets, which was able to tell me the operating system of the device that was scanned, aswell as what ports were open on the devices. NMAP also includes a feature that lets you visually map out all of the different IP addresses, which can be seen below.

## Diving Deeper

Once these devices were discovered, I was able to sort through the addresses and find devices that I wanted to target. These included many things such as projectors, smart TV's, printers, Universal Power Supplies, Routers, Access Points, and most notably Security Cameras. Most all of the devices located had an open HTTP/HTTPS port, so I could easily access the Web GUI to look for vulnerabilities.

## Vulnerabilities

After accessing the Web GUI for these devices, I wanted to see if there was any way I could gain access to the device. After doing some Open-Source Intelligence, I recored the default credentials for these different devices and tried using them to log in. I was shocked to see that most of the devices still had the default admin credentials set on them. This allowed me to escalate my privilleges, and if I was a bad actor, do detrimental damage to these devices, aswell as the integrity of the Wentworth eduoroam network.



## ‚úÖ Lessons Learned
- You should always practice proper network segmentation and use Vlans. There is no reason that anybody connected to the network should be able to do a port scan for all devices on that network.
- Change the default credentials to your devices, and use two-factor authentication!
